<h2>Description</h2>
<p>As you see on the attached screenshot, the WoZ tool displays a screen full of
  buttons, where each button corresponds to a character response. A WoZ operator
  (wizard) pushes a button and triggers the response that can either be a
  playback of an audio recording, a video clip, or an animation sequence handled
  Smartbody and rendering engine. The WoZ tool does not do any media playback
  itself. It relies on an external component to handle the media. From the
  technical point, each button has an associated vhmsg that is triggered when
  the button is pushed. For example, it can be a vrExpress message with a video
  clip file name supplied as a parameter. We have a separate VideoPlayer tool
  that listens for vrExpress messages, parses the message content, finds the
  video file with the right name, and plays it on the screen.</p>
<p>The buttons are arranged into rows, where every row has a title. The rows are
  arranged into screens, where every screen has a title. You can specify buttons
  that trigger transitions between the screens. The same button can appear in
  multiple rows and the same row can appear on multiple screens.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Data Format</h3>

<p>The data for the wizard comes from several tables (as in database tables) and
  can be created as an Excel or Google Sheet spreadsheet. Each table should be
  defined as
  separate sheet in the spreadsheet. The following sheets can be defined. 3
  of the sheets are required and 1 is optional.</p>

<img style="width: 365px" src="Screen Shot 2014-06-12 at 12.08.26 PM.png"/>

<h3>Button Sheet</h3>
<p>A sheet with the name &quot;buttons&quot; specifies all the buttons in the
  interface. Each row corresponds to a single button and the columns map to
  button's attributes. The first row contains the column headers. The following
  column (and the corresponding headers) are required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>woz.id &ndash; the button ID in the file. All the IDs have to be unique
    among all objects in the database. Think about the ID as a database ID used
    for indexing, storing, and retrieving table rows
  </li>
  <li>woz.label &ndash; the text that would appear on the button</li>
  <li>woz.tooltip &ndash; the tooltip for the button. See the Section below for
    interactive text entry option.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The following attributes are optional:</p>

<ul>
  <li>woz.color &ndash; the color ID for the button background color.&nbsp;</li>
  <!--<li>woz.icon &ndash; the icon ID for an image to put on the button (the images-->
  <!--are currently not supported)-->
  <!--</li>-->
  <li>woz.vhmsg&nbsp;&ndash; the VHMSG message to send when the button is
    pressed. Please see the Section below for details.
  </li>
  <li>woz.transition &ndash; the ID of the screen the interface should present
    after the button is clicked. If this attribute is omitted, the WoZ interface
    will stay on the same screen
  </li>
  <li>woz.badge.[location] &ndash; is the &quot;badge&quot; that is placed on
    the button. The location is defined as either &quot;top-left&quot;,
    &quot;top-center&quot;, &quot;top-right&quot;, &quot;middle-left&quot;,
    &quot;middle-right&quot;, &quot;bottom-left&quot;,
    &quot;bottom-center&quot;,
    &quot;bottom-right&quot;. Take a look at the following screenshot, the
    button shows two badges. The top-right badge has a clip number (00018) and
    the bottom-right badge indicates the audio rating. The latter is a sequence
    of unicode characters (the unicode &quot;full moon&quot;) and not an icon.
  </li>
</ul>

  sheet.</p>

<h4>Interactive Text Entry</h4>
<p>The content of the tooltip (and the text of the response) can be modified by
  the user on-the-fly. If the tooltip column contains the ##input## token, when
  the user clicks on the button, she will be presented with a dialog box, with
  the text of the tooltip where each&nbsp;##input## is replaced by a text entry
  field. After entering information into the field, the user can press the Send
  button on the dialog to send the modified text in the vhmsg. In the following
  example the tooltip column contains &quot;Let's start. ##input##&quot;.
  &nbsp;</p>

<img style="width: 690px" src="Screen Shot 2016-03-22 at 7.52.55 PM.png"/>

<h4>VHMSG Message Format</h4>
<p>If the &quot;woz.vhmsg&quot; column is omitted, WoZ will send a vrExpress
  populated with id and tooltip. If columns &quot;woz.sender&quot; and &quot;woz.addressee&quot;
  are present, WoZ will use those values to fill the appropriate parts of the
  message. If the columns are omitted WoZ uses values &quot;visitor&quot; and
  &quot;all&quot;. The message content can be specified explicitly or it can be
  defined as a template using the values in other columns as variables. For
  example, the default behavior can be reproduced by using&nbsp;</p>

<p class="quote">
  vrExpress $$sender$$ $$addressee$$
  $$sender$$$$messageCount$$ &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;
  standalone=&quot;no&quot; ?&gt;&lt;act&gt;&lt;participant id=&quot;$$XML(sender)$$&quot;
  role=&quot;actor&quot; /&gt;&lt;fml&gt;&lt;turn start=&quot;take&quot; end=&quot;give&quot;
  /&gt;&lt;affect type=&quot;neutral&quot;
  target=&quot;addressee&quot;&gt;&lt;/affect&gt;&lt;culture
  type=&quot;neutral&quot;&gt;&lt;/culture&gt;&lt;personality
  type=&quot;neutral&quot;&gt;&lt;/personality&gt;&lt;/fml&gt;
  &lt;bml&gt;&lt;speech
  id=&quot;sp1&quot; ref=&quot;$$XML(id)$$&quot;
  type=&quot;application/ssml+xml&quot;&gt;
  $$XML(tooltip)$$
  &lt;/speech&gt;&lt;/bml&gt;&lt;/act&gt;
</p>

<p>Here the content of column &quot;woz.sender&quot; will be the second token in
  the message and so on. Note that the variable name omits &quot;woz.&quot; from
  the column title.</p>
<p>Note that in case when the message contains XML code, you need to make the
  content of the variables is encoded appropriately when inserted into the
  message. We introduce <strong>XML(&bull;)</strong>&nbsp;to indicate those
  cases. For example,&nbsp;$$XML(sender)$$ will take the content of woz.sender
  column and encode is as valid XML (e.g., replace &quot;&lt;&quot; with &quot;&amp;lt;&quot;)
  before inserting it into the message.</p>

<h4>Automatic generation of transition buttons&nbsp;</h4>

<p>You can specify the buttons for transitions between screens by hand as
  described in the previous section, but sometimes it would be better to
  generate them automatically from the content of the screens sheet (see the
  Screen Sheet section for the details). You can do something like this:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">&nbsp;</th>
    <th>J</th>
    <th>K (woz.id)</th>
    <th>L (woz.label)</th>
    <th>M (woz.color)</th>
    <th>O (woz.transition)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">2900</th>
    <td>=ROW()</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">2901</th>
    <td>=FLOOR((ROW()-J$2900-1)/2,1)+1</td>
    <td>=IF(J2901&lt;=COUNTA(screens!$1:$1),<br/> <span>CONCATENATE(&quot;transition.&quot;,N2901),&quot;&quot;)</span>
    </td>
    <td>=INDEX(screens!$1:$2,2,J2901)</td>
    <td>color.tab</td>
    <td>=INDEX(screens!$1:$2,1,J2901)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">2902</th>
    <td>=FLOOR((ROW()-J$2900-1)/2,1)+1</td>
    <td>=IF(J2902&lt;=COUNTA(screens!$1:$1),<br/> <span>CONCATENATE(&quot;transition.&quot;,N2902,&quot;.selected&quot;),&quot;&quot;)</span>
    </td>
    <td>=INDEX(screens!$1:$2,2,J2902)</td>
    <td>color.tab.selected</td>
    <td>=INDEX(screens!$1:$2,1,J2902)</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Repeat the last two lines for every screen on the
  screen sheet (copy the last two rows and keep pasting them until the cells in
  the woz.id column starts showing up empty. Make sure you adjust the column and
  row references appropriately.</p>
<p>You should get something like this:</p>

<img style="width: 646px" src="Screen Shot 2014-06-13 at 2.38.17 PM.png"/>

<h3>Row Sheet</h3>
<p>A sheet with the name &quot;rows&quot; specifies all the button rows in the
  interface. Each Excel table <strong>row</strong> corresponds to a single row
  in the interface. The first column contains the row ID, the second column
  contains the row title, the rest of the columns contain the row's buttons, one
  button ID per cell. The order of the buttons in the WoZ interface will be the
  same as the order of the buttons in the Excel table. Note that the first row
  in the table is an actual row in the WoZ interface. It specifies buttons that
  transition between different screens. Also note the different number of
  buttons in each row. For example, row 11 contains just one button, while row 3
  references at least three buttons.</p>

<img style="width: 1221px" src="Screen Shot 2014-06-12 at 12.02.59 PM.png"/>

<h4>Automatic generation of tab rows</h4>
<p>You can specify the tab row (the row with buttons that transition between
  screens) by hand as described in the previous section, but sometimes it would
  be better to generate them automatically from the content of the screens sheet
  (see the Screen Sheet section for the details). You can do something like
  this:</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">&nbsp;</th>
    <th colspan="1">A</th>
    <th colspan="1">B</th>
    <th colspan="1">C</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">230</th>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>=ROW()</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">231</th>
    <td>=IF(<span style="color: rgb(51,102,255);">ROW()-$B$230</span>&lt;=<span
        style="color: rgb(0,128,0);">COUNTA(screens!$1:$1)</span>,<br/> <span>CONCATENATE(&quot;tab.&quot;,INDEX(screens!$1:$1,1,<span
        style="color: rgb(51,102,255);">ROW()-$B$230</span>)),&quot;&quot;)</span>
    </td>
    <td>Screens</td>
    <td>=IF(OR(<span
        style="color: rgb(51,102,255);">ROW()-$B$230</span>&gt;<span
        style="color: rgb(0,128,0);">COUNTA(screens!$1:$1)</span>,<span
        style="color: rgb(255,102,0);">COLUMN()-2</span>&gt;<span
        style="color: rgb(0,128,0);">COUNTA(screens!$1:$1)</span>),&quot;&quot;,<br/>CONCATENATE(&quot;transition.&quot;,INDEX(screens!$1:$1,1,<span
        style="color: rgb(255,102,0);">COLUMN()-2</span>),IF(<span
        style="color: rgb(51,102,255);">ROW()-$B$230</span>=<span
        style="color: rgb(255,102,0);">COLUMN()-2</span>,&quot;.selected&quot;,&quot;&quot;)))
    </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can have the same tab row for every screen. You
  can also elect to build tab rows that are different for individual screens.
  For example, you may want to highlight the button corresponding to the current
  screen with special color. That what the table illustrates.&nbsp;This will
  generate a tab row for every screen.&nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ROW()-$B$230 is the row index for the current row.
  </li>
  <li>COLUMN()-2 is the column index for the current column
  </li>
  <li>COUNTA(screens!$1:$1) is the number of screens (the number of columns on
    the
    screen sheet)
  </li>
  <li>INDEX(screens!$1:$1,1, COLUMN()-2) is the screen ID.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose N is the number of screens, you need to copy the row (231) N times.
  And, then copy the column (C) N times. You should get something like this:</p>

<img style="width: 900px" src="Screen Shot 2014-06-13 at 2.38.41 PM.png"/>

<h3>Screen Sheet</h3>
<p>A sheet with the name &quot;screens&quot; specifies all the button screens in
  the interface. Each Excel table <strong>column</strong> corresponds to a
  single screen in the interface. The first row in the column contains the
  screen ID, the second row contains the screen title, the rest of the rows
  contain the screen's rows, one row ID per cell. The order of the rows in the
  WoZ interface will be the same as the order of the rows in the Excel table.
  Note how the first row (id &quot;tab.row&quot;) is the same across multiple
  screens.</p>

<img style="width: 608px" src="Screen Shot 2014-06-12 at 12.01.01 PM.png"/>

<h4>Automatic generation of tab rows</h4>
<p>If you are generating the tab rows using Excel formulas as described in the
  previous section, you can insert the tab row into the screen sheet as shown in
  the table.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">&nbsp;</th>
    <th colspan="1">A</th>
    <th colspan="1">B</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">1</th>
    <td>Intro</td>
    <td>Pre-War</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">2</th>
    <td>Intro</td>
    <td>Pre-War</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="1">3</th>
    <td>=CONCATENATE(&quot;tab.&quot;,A1)</td>
    <td>=CONCATENATE(&quot;tab.&quot;,B1)</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Color Sheet</h3>

<p>A sheet with the name &quot;colors&quot; specifies
  all the button colors in the interface. Each Excel
  table&nbsp;<strong>row</strong>&nbsp;corresponds to a single color in the
  interface. The first column contains the color ID, the other three columns
  specify the color component values either as RGB or HSB tuples. The first row
  in the table contains the column headers. The attached screenshot shows the
  colors defined by the hue, saturation, and brightness values. If you want to
  use RGB, put &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;blue&quot; in the
  corresponding column titles.</p>

<p class="quote">
  Some
  suggested to use Excel cell styles and background color to specify the
  colors for the buttons. Due to the extremely archaic way Excel stores and
  handles colors (don't ask) extracting the color component values that
  would result in colors that look anywhere close to the cell background
  proved extremely difficult, nigh impossible.
